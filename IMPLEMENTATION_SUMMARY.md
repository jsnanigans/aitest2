# Quick Build Summary

## Plan Implemented
- Report: `/Users/brendanmullins/Projects/aitest/strem_process_anchor/reports/retrospective-quality-override.md`
- Requirement: Respect quality scores in outlier detection, never mark high-quality measurements as outliers

## Changes Made

### Modified Files

1. **`/Users/brendanmullins/Projects/aitest/strem_process_anchor/src/outlier_detection.py`**
   - Added database parameter to constructor for Kalman state access
   - Added quality score threshold (0.7) and Kalman deviation threshold (0.15)
   - Created `_detect_kalman_outliers()` method for prediction-based detection
   - Modified `detect_outliers()` to:
     - Protect high-quality measurements (quality > 0.7)
     - Use AND logic: outlier only if low quality AND statistical outlier AND Kalman outlier
   - Updated `get_clean_measurements()` to accept user_id parameter

2. **`/Users/brendanmullins/Projects/aitest/strem_process_anchor/main.py`**
   - Pass database instance to OutlierDetector constructor (line 84)
   - Include quality_score and quality_components in measurement metadata (lines 304-305)
   - Pass user_id to outlier detector in retrospective processing (line 494)

### New Files

3. **`/Users/brendanmullins/Projects/aitest/strem_process_anchor/test_quality_override.py`**
   - Comprehensive test suite validating quality score protection
   - Tests AND logic for outlier detection
   - All tests passing

4. **`/Users/brendanmullins/Projects/aitest/strem_process_anchor/docs/quality_override_implementation.md`**
   - Detailed documentation of implementation

## Key Implementation Details

- **Quality Protection**: Measurements with quality_score > 0.7 are never marked as outliers
- **AND Logic**: Measurement must fail BOTH quality checks AND statistical tests to be outlier
- **Kalman Integration**: Added prediction deviation as primary outlier signal
- **Backward Compatible**: Gracefully handles missing quality scores or Kalman states

## Validation

```bash
python3 test_quality_override.py
```
Result: ALL TESTS PASSED âœ“

- High-quality measurements preserved regardless of statistical deviation
- Only measurements with low quality AND statistical anomalies removed
- AND logic working correctly

## Configuration

New options available in `config.toml`:
```toml
[retrospective.outlier_detection]
quality_score_threshold = 0.7     # Protect measurements above this quality
kalman_deviation_threshold = 0.15  # Max deviation from Kalman prediction
```

## Notes

- No dependencies added
- Syntax validated with `py_compile`
- Test coverage demonstrates correct behavior
- System now respects quality scores while still removing true outliers

## Follow-ups

None required - implementation complete and tested.
