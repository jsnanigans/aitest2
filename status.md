# Status Report: Rejection Tracking Fix

## Issue Summary
Main.py outputs were not including rejected values after refactoring between commits kttxpzno (working) and zzyzzlty (broken).

## Root Cause
The PersistenceValidator was looking for a field named 'kalman_state' but the actual state dictionary used 'last_state'. This mismatch caused state persistence to fail, making every measurement be treated as initial (and thus accepted).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Database Implementation
- Removed SQLite integration per user request
- Replaced with in-memory dictionary storage
- Location: `src/database/database.py`

### 2. Fixed PersistenceValidator
- Updated field name from 'kalman_state' to 'last_state'
- Added proper numpy array handling
- Location: `src/processing/persistence_validator.py`

### 3. Fixed Kalman Config Handling
- Added existence checks before accessing config keys
- Prevented KeyError for 'transition_covariance_weight'
- Location: `src/processing/processor.py` (lines 510-516)

## Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Rejection tracking is working correctly:
- Test run shows 142 accepted, 111 rejected out of 253 total measurements
- Visualization index.html contains correct rejection counts in embedded data
- Detail charts display appropriate rejection information

## Verification
The visualization index shows correct data when inspecting the HTML source:
- User 1: 107 rejected
- User 2: 4 rejected
- User 3: 0 rejected

The issue is fully resolved and the system is tracking rejections as expected.
