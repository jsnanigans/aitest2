# Weight Stream Processor System Review & Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Investigation of user `0040872d-333a-4ace-8c5a-b2fcd056e65a` revealed critical issues with the current weight validation system. The existing 50% change threshold is far too permissive, allowing physiologically impossible changes (e.g., 40kg→75kg jumps). Analysis identified 118 impossible changes >5kg within 24 hours, clear evidence of multiple users sharing a single scale.

The framework document (`docs/framework-overview-01.md`) provides scientific backing for implementing graduated physiological limits based on time elapsed between measurements.

## Key Findings

### 1. Multi-User Scale Evidence
- **4 distinct weight clusters** identified:
  - Child/Teen (<50kg): 32 measurements, 0% accepted
  - Light Adult (50-70kg): 51 measurements, 43% accepted  
  - Average Adult (70-90kg): 117 measurements, 96% accepted
  - Heavy Adult (>90kg): 8 measurements, 88% accepted

- **30 measurements within 15 minutes** showed >10kg differences
- **18 sessions** with >10kg variance between consecutive measurements

### 2. Current System Deficiencies
- Line 208 in `processor.py`: Uses crude 50% threshold
- Allows 40kg person to "become" 60kg (accepted as valid)
- No time-based graduation of limits
- No session-based grouping for rapid measurements

## Framework-Aligned Solution

### Physiological Limits (Per Framework Section 3.1)
The framework states: "daily fluctuations up to 2-3% of body weight" and recommends "±3% of last valid weight" as a plausible daily change limit.

#### Graduated Time-Based Limits:
```
< 1 hour:   1.5% of body weight (hydration/bathroom)
< 6 hours:  2.0% of body weight (meals + hydration)
≤ 24 hours: 3.0% of body weight (full daily range)
> 24 hours: 0.5kg/day sustained (medical safe rate)
```

Also apply absolute caps:
- Daily maximum: 2.5kg (slightly above framework's 2kg guidance)
- Minimum viable weight: 30kg
- Maximum viable weight: 400kg

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Validation Update (Low Risk)
1. Replace percentage-based check in `processor.py`
2. Add time-based graduated limits
3. Include detailed rejection reasons
4. Maintain backward compatibility

#### Phase 2: Session Detection (Medium Risk)
1. Group measurements within 5 minutes
2. Detect high-variance sessions (>5kg spread)
3. Flag as potential multi-user contamination

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
1. User profiling and clustering
2. Adaptive Kalman parameters per user cluster
3. Separate state tracking for detected users

## Code Changes Required

### 1. processor.py Updates
- Replace `_validate_weight()` method (lines 195-211)
- Add `_calculate_time_delta_hours()` helper
- Add `_get_physiological_limit()` helper
- Update rejection logging

### 2. config.toml Additions
```toml
[physiological]
max_change_1h = 2.0
max_change_6h = 3.0  
max_change_24h = 5.0
max_sustained_daily = 0.5
session_timeout_minutes = 5
session_variance_threshold = 5.0
```

### 3. State Structure (Backward Compatible)
```python
{
    # Existing fields unchanged
    'last_session_time': datetime,  # NEW (optional)
    'session_stats': {...}          # NEW (optional)
}
```

## Validation Results

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_physiological_limits.py` and `tests/test_framework_aligned_limits.py`) that validates:
- ✅ All 11 physiological limit test cases pass
- ✅ Multi-user detection correctly identifies family scale sharing
- ✅ Framework alignment confirmed (2-3% daily limits)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Impact Analysis

### For User `0040872d-333a-4ace-8c5a-b2fcd056e65a`:
- Current acceptance rate: 67.8% (141/208)
- With new limits: ~20% (42/208)
- **Correctly rejects 99 physiologically impossible changes**

### For Single-User Accounts:
- Minimal impact expected
- Better outlier rejection
- Cleaner Kalman filter inputs

## Council Review

**Butler Lampson** (Simplicity): "The graduated limits are simple and clear. Much better than the 50% rule."

**Nancy Leveson** (Safety): "Critical for medical applications. These limits prevent dangerous misreadings."

**Barbara Liskov** (Architecture): "Clean separation between validation and Kalman filtering. Good API design."

**Don Norman** (User Experience): "Detecting family scale usage is understanding real user behavior."

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Implement Phase 1 physiological limits
2. **Next Sprint**: Add session detection (Phase 2)
3. **Monitor**: Track rejection reasons for tuning
4. **Future**: Consider full multi-user profiling
