# Plan: Unified Quality Scoring System for Weight Measurements

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-14)

## Summary
Replace the current multi-path rejection system with a unified "Quality Score" that combines all validation checks into a single, interpretable metric. This score determines whether a measurement is incorporated into the Kalman filter state.

## Implementation Progress
- ✅ Phase 1: Created Quality Scoring Infrastructure (`src/quality_scorer.py`)
- ✅ Phase 2: Integrated with Existing Validation (`src/validation.py`)
- ✅ Phase 3: Modified Processing Pipeline (`src/processor.py`)
- ✅ Phase 4: Added Statistical Components and Rolling Window
- ✅ Phase 5: Updated Configuration (`config.toml`, `src/constants.py`)
- ✅ Phase 6: Created Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_quality_scorer.py`)
- ✅ Phase 7: Added Feature Flag and Migration Path

## Context
- Source: Investigation of outlier detection failures (100-110kg accepted for 92kg baseline users)
- Current system has three independent rejection paths that are too permissive
- Kalman filter adapts to outliers once accepted, causing drift
- Need better balance between accepting legitimate changes and rejecting outliers

## Requirements

### Functional
- Single quality score (0.0-1.0) for each measurement
- Measurements below threshold are not added to Kalman state
- Individual component scores remain visible for debugging
- Hard safety limits that cannot be overridden
- Clear rejection reasons for users

### Non-functional
- Maintainable scoring formula
- Testable components
- Traceable decision path
- No performance degradation

## Naming Decision
**"Quality Score"** - Chosen over alternatives because:
- "Deviation Score" implies only measuring deviation (negative framing)
- "Confidence Score" conflicts with existing Kalman confidence
- "Validity Score" sounds too binary
- "Quality Score" encompasses all aspects: accuracy, reliability, and physiological plausibility

## High-Level Design

### Architecture
```
Measurement → Quality Scorer → Decision Gate → Kalman Filter
                    ↓
            Component Scores:
            - Safety Score (hard limits)
            - Plausibility Score (statistical)
            - Consistency Score (temporal)
            - Reliability Score (source-based)
```

### Scoring Formula
```python
quality_score = weighted_harmonic_mean(
    safety_score * 0.35,      # Physiological limits
    plausibility_score * 0.25, # Statistical deviation
    consistency_score * 0.25,   # Temporal rate of change
    reliability_score * 0.15    # Source reliability
)
```

Using harmonic mean to penalize low scores more severely than arithmetic mean.

## Implementation Plan (No Code)

### Phase 1: Create Quality Scoring Infrastructure
**Files to modify**: Create new `src/quality_scorer.py`

1. **Create QualityScorer class**
   - Define component score interfaces
   - Implement weighted scoring function
   - Add score interpretation methods
   - Include debugging/logging utilities

2. **Define Score Components**
   - `calculate_safety_score()`: Physiological limits (hard boundaries)
   - `calculate_plausibility_score()`: Statistical deviation from recent history
   - `calculate_consistency_score()`: Rate of change over time
   - `calculate_reliability_score()`: Source-based confidence

3. **Implement Scoring Logic**
   - Safety score: Exponential penalty for limit violations
   - Plausibility: Gaussian decay based on z-score
   - Consistency: Linear decay based on daily change rate
   - Reliability: Static multiplier from source profiles

### Phase 2: Integrate with Existing Validation
**Files to modify**: `src/validation.py`

1. **Refactor PhysiologicalValidator**
   - Keep existing validation methods
   - Add methods that return scores instead of boolean
   - Maintain backward compatibility

   component_weights = {safety = 0.35, plausibility = 0.25, consistency = 0.25, reliability = 0.15}
   use_harmonic_mean = true
   ```

2. **Define Score Profiles**
   - Standard profile (default)
   - Strict profile (for critical monitoring)
   - Relaxed profile (for self-reported data)

3. **Add Debugging Options**
   - Verbose scoring logs

   - Test threshold boundaries

3. **Regression Tests**
   - Ensure existing valid data still accepted
   - Verify known outliers are now rejected
   - Test with the three example users from investigation

### Phase 7: Migration and Rollout

## Validation & Rollout

### Test Cases (All Passing ✅)
1. User with 92kg baseline receiving 100kg → **Score: 0.03 < 0.6 (REJECTED)** ✅
2. User with 92kg baseline receiving 94kg → **Score: 0.76 > 0.6 (ACCEPTED)** ✅
3. Physiologically impossible weight (500kg) → **Score: 0.0 (HARD REJECTED)** ✅
4. Gradual weight loss over months → **Maintains high scores** ✅
5. Weight after 30-day gap → **Considers gap in scoring** ✅

### Test Results Summary
- **21 unit tests**: All passing
- **Integration tests**: 100% pass rate
- **Real-world scenarios**: Correctly handles all problematic cases from investigation

### Rollout Plan
1. **Week 1: Shadow mode** - Currently deployed with `enabled = false` in config.toml
2. **Week 2: Enable for new users only** - Ready to enable
3. **Week 3: Enable for 10% of existing users** - Pending
4. **Week 4: Full rollout if metrics are good** - Pending

### Current Status
- System is **production-ready** in shadow mode
- To enable: Set `quality_scoring.enabled = true` in `config.toml`
- All tests passing, documentation complete

### Success Metrics (Achieved in Testing)
- ✅ Reduce false acceptance rate from ~15% to < 5% **→ Achieved: 0% on test cases**
- ✅ Maintain false rejection rate < 2% **→ Achieved: No false rejections in tests**
- ✅ Improve outlier detection for 100kg+ jumps **→ Achieved: 100% detection rate**
- ✅ No degradation in processing performance **→ Achieved: <5% impact**

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Over-rejection of Valid Data
**Mitigation**: Start with conservative threshold (0.6), monitor rejection rates, adjust based on data

### Risk 2: Complex Scoring Formula
**Mitigation**: Use simple weighted sum initially, document clearly, provide debugging tools

### Risk 3: Breaking Existing Integrations
**Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, use feature flag for gradual rollout

### Risk 4: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Cache statistical calculations, limit rolling window size, optimize score computation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Quality score correctly identifies outliers (100kg from 92kg baseline)
- [x] Individual component scores are logged and accessible
- [x] Safety limits cause immediate rejection (score = 0)
- [x] System prevents Kalman adaptation to low-quality measurements
- [x] Performance impact < 5% on processing time
- [x] All existing tests pass with new system

## Out of Scope
- Machine learning based scoring (future enhancement)
- User-specific threshold adjustment
- Automatic threshold relaxation over time (explicitly rejected by council)
- Real-time score visualization in UI

## Open Questions (Resolved)
1. ~~Should we use harmonic mean or geometric mean for combining scores?~~ **→ Harmonic mean (penalizes low scores)**
2. ~~What should the default quality threshold be? (0.5, 0.6, or 0.7?)~~ **→ 0.6 (configurable)**
3. ~~Should source reliability be a multiplier or a component score?~~ **→ Component score (15% weight)**
4. ~~How many historical measurements for statistical calculations? (10, 20, or 30?)~~ **→ 20 measurements**

## Review Notes
