# Plan: Phase 5 - Monitoring & Operations

## Summary
Implement comprehensive monitoring, observability, and operational tooling to ensure reliable service operation, quick issue detection, and efficient troubleshooting.

## Context
- Prerequisites: Phases 0-4 complete (Full API with optimizations)

- Target state: Full observability stack with operational excellence

## Requirements
- Real-time monitoring of service health
- Detailed performance metrics
- Distributed tracing for request flow
- Alerting for critical issues
- Operational runbooks and automation
- Cost tracking and optimization

## Alternatives

### Option A: AWS-Native Stack
**Approach**: CloudWatch + X-Ray + Systems Manager
- Pros: Native integration, no additional services
- Cons: Limited features, higher costs
- Risks: Vendor lock-in

### Option B: Open Source Stack
**Approach**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger
- Pros: Feature-rich, cost-effective, portable
- Cons: More infrastructure to manage
- Risks: Operational overhead

### Option C: SaaS Solution
**Approach**: Datadog or New Relic
- Pros: Comprehensive features, minimal setup
- Cons: Expensive at scale
- Risks: Data privacy, vendor dependency

## Recommendation
**Option A: AWS-Native Stack** initially, with path to Option B for scale

## High-Level Design

### Observability Pillars
```
1. Metrics - CloudWatch Metrics
2. Logs - CloudWatch Logs
3. Traces - AWS X-Ray
4. Events - EventBridge
5. Dashboards - CloudWatch Dashboards
6. Alerts - CloudWatch Alarms + SNS
```

### Monitoring Layers
```
Infrastructure → Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway
Application → Service metrics, quality scores
Business → User activity, validation rates
Security → Access patterns, anomalies
Cost → Service usage, optimization opportunities
```

## Implementation Plan (No Code)
