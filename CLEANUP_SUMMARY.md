### Files Removed from `src/`
The following backup and redundant files were moved to `src_backup_20250914_215845/`:

1. **kalman_backup.py** - Backup of Kalman filter implementation
2. **quality_scorer_backup.py** - Backup of quality scorer
3. **quality_scorer_enhanced.py** - Enhanced version only used by test file

### Files Retained in `src/`
The following files remain as they are actively used:

- **__init__.py** - Package initialization with clean exports
- **constants.py** - System constants and configuration
- **database.py** - State persistence layer
- **kalman.py** - Active Kalman filter implementation
- **processor.py** - Core processing logic (stateless)
- **quality_scorer.py** - Active quality scoring implementation
- **utils.py** - Utility functions and logging
- **validation.py** - Data validation and preprocessing
- **visualization.py** - Core visualization functions
- **viz_enhanced.py** - Enhanced visualization (used by test_demo_enhanced.py)
