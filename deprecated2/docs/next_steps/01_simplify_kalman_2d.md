# Step 01: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETED - Verify 2D State Vector Implementation

## Priority: COMPLETED ✓

## Current State
**Good News!** Our implementation in `src/filters/custom_kalman_filter.py` already uses the optimal 2D state vector [weight, weight_change_rate] as recommended by the framework document. The docstring explicitly states: "Tracks both weight and weight change rate (trend) using a 2D state vector."

## Implementation Status
The framework document (Section 4.3) recommends a 2D state vector [weight, velocity], and our current implementation correctly follows this:

1. **State Vector**: `[weight, trend_kg_per_day]` - Correctly 2D (line 52-57)
2. **Transition Matrix**: Properly implemented 2x2 matrix (lines 58-61)
3. **Observation Matrix**: Correctly maps `[1, 0]` (line 62)
4. **Process Noise**: Already diagonal 2x2 matrix (lines 63-66)

## Why This Was Important
The framework document (Section 4.3) emphasizes that a 2D state vector is optimal because:
- Human weight follows a constant-velocity model over short periods
- Adding acceleration increases complexity without improving accuracy
- Smaller matrices are more numerically stable

## Current Strengths
Our implementation includes sophisticated features beyond basic 2D Kalman:
- **Source-based trust adjustment** (lines 176-186)
- **Time-adaptive process noise** (lines 159-173)
- **Bias detection and correction** (lines 149-156)
- **Outlier rejection with velocity constraints** (lines 212-234)

## Remaining Issues to Address
While the state vector is correct, the implementation has other gaps:

1. **No IQR-based baseline establishment** (Step 02)
2. **Missing validation gate** before Kalman updates (Step 03)
3. **Process noise matrix structure** needs review (Step 04)
4. **No Kalman smoother** for historical data (Step 05)
5. **No change point detection** (Step 06)

## Next Action Required
**Move to Step 02**: Implement the robust baseline protocol using IQR → Median → MAD as specified in the framework document Section 2.3.

## Validation Completed
✓ State vector is 2D: `[weight, trend]`
✓ Transition matrix is 2x2
✓ Observation matrix is `[1, 0]`
✓ Process noise is 2x2 diagonal
✓ Filter converges within expected timeframe
✓ Trend estimates are physiologically plausible (clamped to ±0.15 kg/day)
