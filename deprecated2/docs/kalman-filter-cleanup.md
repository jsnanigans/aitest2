# Kalman Filter Code Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Filter Implementation
- **Created `src/filters/custom_kalman_filter.py`**: Single, clean implementation of the Kalman filter
  - Renamed from `TrendKalmanFilter` to `CustomKalmanFilter` for clarity
  - Removed redundant `AdaptiveTrendKalmanFilter` class (both classes had similar functionality)
  - Includes all improvements: time-adaptive process noise, velocity-aware outlier rejection, trend tracking

### 2. Separated Utilities
- **Created `src/filters/kalman_utils.py`**: Moved parameter learning function to separate utility file
  - `learn_parameters_from_data()`: EM algorithm for learning filter parameters from historical data
  - Cleaner separation of concerns

### 3. Simplified Main Processing
- **Updated `main.py`**:
  - Removed all configuration checks for `use_adaptive_kalman`
  - Always uses `CustomKalmanFilter` (no more conditional filter selection)
  - Simplified filter initialization to just `CustomKalmanFilter()`
  - Removed redundant filter type checks in output

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Maintained `src/filters/kalman_filter.py`** as compatibility layer:
  - Maps old class names (`TrendKalmanFilter`, `AdaptiveTrendKalmanFilter`) to `CustomKalmanFilter`
  - Maps old function names to new implementations
  - Existing code using old names will continue to work

### 5. Configuration Cleanup
- Removed `use_adaptive_kalman` config option (no longer needed)
- Filter type is now always "Custom 2D Trend" with all features enabled

## Benefits

1. **Simpler codebase**: One filter implementation instead of two
2. **Cleaner architecture**: Clear separation between filter logic and utilities
3. **Better maintainability**: All filter improvements in one place
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing code continues to work
5. **Consistent behavior**: No more conditional logic for filter selection

## Key Features of CustomKalmanFilter

- **2D state tracking**: Weight and trend (kg/day)
- **Enhanced time-adaptive process noise**: Better handling of measurement gaps
- **Velocity-aware outlier rejection**: Detects physically impossible changes
- **Trend statistics**: Tracks trend history and changes
- **Future prediction**: 7-day weight prediction capability
- **Innovation analysis**: Outlier detection and diagnostics

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- Basic weight tracking ✅
- Gap handling (sparse data) ✅
- Future prediction ✅
- Innovation analysis ✅
- Backward compatibility ✅

The filter now handles the problematic user case (02D802E1CEA044229BFA58ACC9311687) correctly with improved adaptation after gaps.
