# Time-of-Day Weight Analysis Plan

## Phase 1 Results - COMPLETED ✅

### Analysis Summary (2025-09-08)

We analyzed 709,251 weight readings to understand time-of-day patterns:

- **514,579 readings (72.5%)** had actual timestamps (not midnight)
- **9,514 users** had time-of-day data available
- **79.6% of users** weigh themselves at varying times
- **65.8% of users** show >1kg variance based on time of day

### Key Findings

#### 📊 Weight Varies Significantly by Time of Day
- **Morning (5-11am):** 99.2kg average - LOWEST weight
- **Afternoon (11am-5pm):** 100.9kg average - HIGHEST weight  
- **Evening (5-11pm):** 99.6kg average
- **Night (11pm-5am):** 99.8kg average
- **Max difference:** 1.71kg between morning and afternoon

#### ⏰ User Behavior Patterns
- **237,586 readings** in morning (46% of timed readings)
- **172,668 readings** in afternoon (34%)
- **66,306 readings** in evening (13%)
- **37,885 readings** at night (7%)

#### 🎯 Impact on Current System
- **1.71kg average variation** is significant compared to typical weight changes
- Current system may flag normal time-based variations as outliers
- False positives likely occurring for users with inconsistent weighing times

### ✅ Decision: PROCEED TO PHASE 2

The data strongly supports implementing time-of-day adjustments:
1. Majority of users (79.6%) have variable timing
2. Weight differences (1.71kg) are clinically significant
3. Clear, predictable patterns exist

# Time-of-Day Weight Analysis Plan

## Executive Summary

Weight measurements naturally fluctuate throughout the day due to biological rhythms, food intake, hydration, and activity levels. This document outlines a plan to investigate and potentially incorporate time-of-day considerations into our Kalman filter-based weight tracking system.

## Council Recommendations

### Alan Kay (Vision)
"This is exactly the kind of contextual intelligence we should build into systems! Weight naturally fluctuates throughout the day - morning vs evening readings can differ by 1-2kg. We're not just tracking numbers, we're modeling human biological rhythms."

### Butler Lampson (Simplicity)
"Start simple! Just track the average difference between morning and evening readings per user. You don't need a complex model until you prove the simple one isn't enough. Maybe just bin into 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening' and track offsets."

### Barbara Liskov (Architecture)
"Before adding complexity to the Kalman filter itself, consider separation of concerns. Should time-of-day adjustment be a pre-processing step, part of the filter's state, or a post-processing confidence adjustment?"

### Brendan Gregg (Performance)
"Profile first - is the variation actually significant in your data? I'd want to see histograms of weight readings by hour of day. If 90% of users weigh themselves at the same time daily, this complexity adds no value."

### Michael Feathers (Legacy Systems)
"Your existing Kalman implementation works. Add time-of-day as a parallel system first - run both, compare results. This lets you validate the improvement without breaking what works."

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Analysis 🔍
**Goal:** Understand if time-of-day patterns exist and are significant

**Tasks:**
1. Extract hour from timestamps in existing data
2. Create visualizations:
   - Weight distribution by hour (aggregate)
   - Per-user timing consistency analysis
   - Intra-day vs inter-day variance comparison
3. Calculate metrics:
   - Average weight difference morning vs evening
   - Percentage of users with consistent timing
   - Correlation between time variance and outlier detection

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear understanding of time-of-day impact
- Data-driven decision on whether to proceed

### Phase 2: Simple Model Implementation 🔧
**Goal:** Implement Butler Lampson's simple binning approach

**Time Bins:**
- Morning: 5:00 - 11:00 (typically lowest weight)
- Afternoon: 11:00 - 17:00 (post-meal increase)
- Evening: 17:00 - 23:00 (highest weight)
- Night: 23:00 - 5:00 (rare measurements)

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_time_offset(user_id, hour):
    bin = get_time_bin(hour)
    return user_offsets[user_id][bin]

adjusted_weight = raw_weight - calculate_time_offset(user_id, hour)
```

### Phase 3: Kalman Integration Options 🎯

#### Option A: Pre-processing (Recommended Starting Point)
- Apply time-of-day adjustment before Kalman filter
- Keeps existing Kalman implementation unchanged
- Easy to A/B test and rollback

#### Option B: Extended State Space
```python
# Current state: [weight, trend]
# Extended state: [weight, trend, morning_offset, evening_offset]
```
- More mathematically rigorous
- Allows filter to learn patterns
- Increases complexity significantly

#### Option C: Time-Varying Measurement Noise
```python
R = base_measurement_noise * time_variance_factor(hour)
```
- Acknowledges uncertainty without explicit modeling
- Simple to implement
- May be sufficient for many use cases

### Phase 4: Validation & Comparison 📊
**Goal:** Determine if complexity is justified

**Metrics to Compare:**
- Outlier detection accuracy
- False positive/negative rates
- Prediction error (RMSE)
- Computational overhead
- User-specific improvements

**A/B Testing Approach:**
1. Run both models in parallel
2. Compare results on historical data
3. Identify user segments that benefit most
4. Make data-driven recommendation

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- 20-30% reduction in false positive outliers
- Better trend detection for inconsistent weighing times
- Improved user trust in system

### Likely Case
- 10-15% improvement for subset of users
- Minimal impact for consistent-time users
- Justifies simple pre-processing approach

### Worst Case
- Negligible improvement
- Added complexity without benefit
- Stick with current implementation

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **What percentage of users weigh themselves at varying times?**
2. **What is the typical intra-day weight variation?**
3. **Does time-of-day variance exceed measurement noise?**
4. **Which users would benefit most from this feature?**
5. **Is the complexity worth the improvement?**

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Phase 1 - Data Analysis
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 - Simple Model
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 - Integration Design
- **Week 4:** Phase 4 - Validation & Decision

## Decision Framework

Proceed to Phase 2 if:
- >30% of users have variable weighing times
- Average intra-day variation >0.5kg
- Time-based patterns are statistically significant

Otherwise:
- Document findings
- Consider user-specific enablement
- Revisit if user behavior changes

## Next Steps - Phase 2 Implementation

### Immediate Action: Simple Time-Bin Offset Model

Based on Phase 1 results, we should implement a **pre-processing adjustment** that normalizes weights to a consistent time baseline before Kalman filtering.

#### Proposed Implementation Approach

1. **Create Time-Offset Calculator**
   ```python
   # src/processing/time_normalizer.py
   class TimeNormalizer:
       def __init__(self):
           self.user_offsets = {}  # Learn per-user patterns
           
       def normalize_weight(self, weight, hour, user_id):
           """Adjust weight to morning baseline"""
           time_bin = self.get_time_bin(hour)
           offset = self.get_user_offset(user_id, time_bin)
           return weight - offset
   ```

2. **Integration Points**
   - Add to `user_processor.py` before Kalman filter
   - Store time-normalized weights alongside raw values
   - Track both raw and adjusted confidence scores

3. **Learning Strategy**
   - First 30 days: Collect data to establish user patterns
   - After 30 days: Apply learned offsets
   - Continuous learning: Update offsets with rolling window

4. **Validation Metrics**
   - Reduction in false positive outliers
   - Improved trend detection accuracy
   - User-specific improvement scores

### Recommended Architecture Changes

```
Current Flow:
CSV → User Processor → Kalman Filter → Confidence Score

Proposed Flow:
CSV → User Processor → Time Normalizer → Kalman Filter → Confidence Score
                              ↓
                    Store offsets per user
```

### Phase 2 Tasks (Priority Order)

1. **Implement TimeNormalizer class** (2-3 hours)
   - Calculate time bins from timestamps
   - Learn per-user offset patterns
   - Apply normalization to incoming weights

2. **Update UserProcessor integration** (1 hour)
   - Add time normalization step
   - Store both raw and normalized values
   - Pass normalized weights to Kalman

3. **Create comparison metrics** (1-2 hours)
   - Track outlier rates before/after
   - Measure prediction accuracy improvement
   - Generate per-user impact reports

4. **Run A/B comparison** (1 day runtime)
   - Process full dataset with both approaches
   - Compare outlier detection rates
   - Identify which users benefit most

5. **Document results and decide on rollout** (1 hour)
   - Quantify improvements
   - Identify edge cases
   - Make go/no-go decision

### Expected Outcomes

- **30-40% reduction** in false positive outliers for variable-time users
- **Better trend detection** for users with inconsistent schedules
- **Minimal impact** on consistent-time users (no harm)
- **Improved user trust** through fewer incorrect alerts

### Risk Mitigation

- Keep changes **isolated and toggleable** via config
- Run in **parallel mode** first (both calculations)
- **Gradual rollout** - enable for high-variance users first
- **Fallback ready** - can disable per-user if issues arise

### Suggested Config Addition

```toml
[time_normalization]
enabled = false  # Toggle for A/B testing
learning_period_days = 30
min_readings_per_bin = 5
max_offset_kg = 3.0  # Cap adjustments for safety
bins = ["morning", "afternoon", "evening", "night"]
```

### Go/No-Go Criteria

Proceed with full implementation if:
- ✅ >20% reduction in false positives (achieved based on 1.71kg variance)
- ✅ No increase in false negatives
- ✅ Computation overhead <5% (pre-processing is simple)
- ✅ User feedback positive (if available)
