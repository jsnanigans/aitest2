## File Structure
```
output_dir/
├── viz_test_no_date/
│   ├── index.html                    # Dashboard viewer (29KB)
│   ├── user001_interactive.html      # User dashboard
│   ├── user002_interactive.html      # User dashboard
│   └── ...
└── results_test_no_date.json         # Source data
```

## Dashboard File Patterns
The viewer now looks for dashboards in this order:
1. `{user_id}_interactive.html` (current format)
2. `{user_id}.html`
3. `dashboard_enhanced_{user_id}.html`
4. `dashboard_{user_id}.html`
5. `viz_{user_id}.html`

## Usage
The index.html is automatically generated when running main.py:
```bash
uv run python main.py data/your_data.csv
# Creates: output/viz_*/index.html
```

Open the generated index.html in any browser to:
- View all users in the sidebar
- Click users to load their dashboards
- Sort by various criteria
- Search/filter users
- Navigate with keyboard

## Technical Details
- **Standalone HTML**: Works offline without server
- **Embedded Data**: User data embedded as JSON
- **File Size**: ~30KB for typical usage
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Validation Checklist
✅ Index.html generates successfully
✅ User list displays all users
✅ Statistics show correctly (total/accepted/rejected)
✅ Sort dropdown works for all options
✅ Sort direction toggle works
✅ Quick sort buttons function
✅ Search box filters users
✅ Clicking user loads dashboard
✅ Arrow keys navigate users
✅ Missing dashboards handled gracefully
✅ Responsive design works
