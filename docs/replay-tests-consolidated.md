# Replay System Tests - Consolidated

## Summary

Successfully consolidated all replay system tests into a single comprehensive test file at `/tests/test_replay_system.py`.

## Test Structure

The consolidated test file includes:

### Mock Classes
- **MockDatabase**: In-memory state storage with failure injection
- **MockProcessor**: Simple measurement processor with failure simulation

### Test Coverage

#### ReplayBuffer Tests (8 tests)
- Buffer creation and basic operations
- Measurement accumulation
- Size limit enforcement (parametrized: 5, 10, 20)
- Buffer clearing
- Thread-safe concurrent additions
- Invalid data handling
- Resource cleanup

#### ReplayManager Tests (10 tests)
- State backup and restore
- Happy path replay
- Missing snapshot handling
- Chronological replay ordering
- Database failure recovery
- Processor failure with rollback
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Empty measurements handling
- Various measurement counts (parametrized: 1, 5, 10)

#### Integration Tests (2 tests)
- Buffer to replay flow
- Concurrent user processing

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all replay tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_replay_system.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_replay_system.py -xvs

# Run specific test class
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_replay_system.py::TestReplayBuffer

# Run with coverage
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_replay_system.py --cov=src.replay --cov=src.processing.replay_buffer
```

## Key Features

### Isolation
- Tests run completely isolated from the main system
- Mock database and processor prevent side effects
- No real file I/O or network operations

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Happy paths for normal operations
- Key failure modes and recovery
- Thread safety verification
- Edge cases like empty data

### Pytest Features Used
- Fixtures for shared test setup
- Parametrization for testing multiple scenarios
- Patching for isolating external dependencies
- Clear test organization with classes

## Test Results

All 22 tests pass successfully:
- 8 ReplayBuffer tests
- 10 ReplayManager tests
- 2 Integration tests
- 2 Parametrized test variations

## Files Changed

1. **Created**: `/tests/test_replay_system.py` (765 lines)
   - Consolidated all replay tests
   - Mock implementations
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. **Removed**: `/tests/replay/` directory
   - Deleted old separated test files
   - Removed redundant test organization

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simpler maintenance**: Single file to update
2. **Better test discovery**: All tests in one place
3. **Shared fixtures**: Reuse mock objects efficiently
4. **Cleaner imports**: No complex module paths
5. **Faster execution**: Less overhead from multiple files

This consolidation maintains all essential test coverage while significantly simplifying the test structure.
