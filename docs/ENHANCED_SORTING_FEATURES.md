# Enhanced Sorting Features - Implementation Summary

## New Sorting Capabilities Added

### 1. Expanded Sort Options (7 fields)
- **User ID** - Alphabetical sorting
- **Total Measurements** - Sort by total data points
- **Accepted Count** - Sort by successful measurements
- **Rejected Count** - Sort by failed measurements  
- **Acceptance Rate (%)** - Sort by quality percentage
- **First Date** - Sort by earliest measurement
- **Last Date** - Sort by most recent measurement

### 2. Quick Sort Buttons
Three one-click buttons for common sorting needs:
- **"Most Rejected"** - Instantly find problematic users (rejected count, descending)
- **"Lowest Rate"** - Find users with quality issues (acceptance rate, ascending)
- **"Most Data"** - Find users with most measurements (total count, descending)

### 3. Visual Enhancements

#### Sort Indicators
- Currently sorted field is **highlighted** in the user list
- Blue outline around the active sort metric
- Bold text for sorted values
- "Sort by:" label for clarity

#### Improved Controls
- Larger, more prominent sort dropdown
- Hover effects on all controls
- Active state for quick sort buttons
- Tooltip on sort direction button
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 4. Better User Experience
- Visual feedback shows what's being sorted
- Quick access to problematic users (high rejections)
- Date sorting helps find old/new data
- Preserved user selection during sort changes

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/viz_index.py` - Added all sorting logic and UI

### Code Enhancements

#### Sort Function
```javascript
// Added date sorting
else if (this.sortField === 'first_date') {
    aVal = a.stats.first_date || '';
    bVal = b.stats.first_date || '';
} else if (this.sortField === 'last_date') {
    aVal = a.stats.last_date || '';
    bVal = b.stats.last_date || '';
}
```

#### Visual Highlighting
```javascript
// Highlight sorted field in user list
const highlightClass = (field) => {
    return this.sortField === field ? 'stat-sorted' : '';
};
```

#### Quick Sort Implementation
```javascript
// One-click sorting for common scenarios
document.querySelectorAll('.quick-sort-btn').forEach(btn => {
    btn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        const sortField = e.target.dataset.sort;
        const sortDirection = e.target.dataset.direction;
        // Apply sort and update UI
    });
});
```

## Visual Examples

### Sort Dropdown
```
Sort by: [Total Measurements ▼] [↓]
```

### Quick Sort Buttons
```
[Most Rejected] [Lowest Rate] [Most Data]
```

### User List with Highlighting
When sorted by "Rejected Count":
```
User: abc123
Total: 100  ✓ 95  ✗ 5 ← Highlighted
         ↑ Bold & outlined when sorted
```

## Use Cases

### Finding Problem Users
1. Click **"Most Rejected"** button
2. Users with most failures appear at top
3. Quickly identify data quality issues

### Finding Low Quality Data
1. Click **"Lowest Rate"** button  
2. Users with worst acceptance rates appear first
3. Target users needing investigation

### Finding Active Users
1. Select **"Last Date"** from dropdown
2. Sort descending (↓)
3. Most recently active users at top

### Finding Historical Data
1. Select **"First Date"** from dropdown
2. Sort ascending (↑)
3. Oldest data appears first

## Testing

## Summary
The enhanced sorting makes it easy to:
- **Find problematic data** quickly
- **Sort by any metric** with one click
