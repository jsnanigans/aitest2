# Configuration Migration Complete

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated the Weight Stream Processor to use the improved configuration system with clearer parameter names and better defaults.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files
- **Replaced** `config.toml` with improved version
- **Removed** old config backups and temporary files
- **New config** uses clearer, more descriptive parameter names

### 2. Parameter Name Changes

| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `weight_boost_factor` | `weight_noise_multiplier` | Multiplies process noise for weight |
| `trend_boost_factor` | `trend_noise_multiplier` | Multiplies process noise for trend |
| `warmup_measurements` | `adaptation_measurements` | Number of measurements in adaptive period |
| `adaptive_days` | `adaptation_days` | Days to stay in adaptive mode |
| `decay_rate` | `adaptation_decay_rate` | Speed of transition to normal |
| `quality_threshold` | `quality_acceptance_threshold` | Minimum quality score for acceptance |

### 3. New Parameters Added

- `initial_variance_multiplier` - Scales initial state uncertainty
- `observation_noise_multiplier` - Scales measurement noise during adaptation
- `quality_safety_weight` - Weight for safety component during adaptation
- `quality_plausibility_weight` - Weight for plausibility during adaptation
- `quality_consistency_weight` - Weight for consistency during adaptation
- `quality_reliability_weight` - Weight for source reliability during adaptation

### 4. Improved Defaults for Initial Reset

The initial reset (first measurements) now uses much more aggressive adaptation:

```toml
[kalman.reset.initial]
initial_variance_multiplier = 10     # High uncertainty
weight_noise_multiplier = 50         # Allow large changes
trend_noise_multiplier = 500         # Allow any trend
observation_noise_multiplier = 0.3   # Trust measurements more
adaptation_measurements = 20          # 20 measurements
adaptation_days = 21                  # 3 weeks
quality_acceptance_threshold = 0.25  # Very lenient (25% vs 60%)
```

### 5. Code Updates

Updated files:
- `src/reset_manager.py` - Uses new parameter names
- `src/kalman_adaptive.py` - Properly applies multipliers
- `src/processor.py` - Uses adaptation parameters from config

### 6. Removed Files

Deleted deprecated scripts:
- `scripts/fix_initial_reset_config.py`
- `scripts/fix_processor_adaptive.py`
- `scripts/implement_improved_reset.py`
- `scripts/fix_adaptive_implementation.py`
- `scripts/implement_adaptive_reset.py`
- `scripts/test_initial_reset_simple.py`
- `scripts/investigate_initial_reset.py`

Deleted old configs:
- `config_improved.toml` (now main config)
- `config_old.toml`
- `config_old_backup.toml`

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Configuration**: Parameter names now clearly indicate their purpose
2. **Better Defaults**: Initial measurements are much more likely to be accepted
3. **More Control**: Separate quality scoring weights for each reset type
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed backward compatibility and deprecated code

## Testing

To verify the migration works correctly:

```bash
# Process a single user to test initial reset
python main.py --user 091baa98-cf05-4399-b490-e24324f7607f

# Or process all users
python main.py data/test_sample.csv
```

The initial measurements should now be accepted due to:
- Higher noise multipliers (50x weight, 500x trend)
- Lower quality threshold (0.25 vs 0.6)
- Longer adaptation period (20 measurements / 21 days)
- Properly scaled initial variance (10x)

## Configuration Structure

The new config has a clear hierarchy:

```
[kalman.reset.initial]    # Most aggressive adaptation
[kalman.reset.hard]       # Moderate adaptation after gaps
[kalman.reset.soft]       # Gentle adaptation for manual entry
```

Each reset type has:
- **Multipliers**: How much to scale Kalman parameters
- **Duration**: How long to stay adaptive
- **Quality**: Acceptance threshold and component weights

## Next Steps

The system is now fully migrated to the improved configuration. You can:

1. Fine-tune the parameters in `config.toml` as needed
2. Monitor acceptance rates for initial measurements
3. Adjust multipliers if adaptation is too aggressive or conservative
