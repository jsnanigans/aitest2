# Reset Logic Improvement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented **Option B: Track Last Attempt Timestamp** with rejection counting to prevent unnecessary resets when rejected data exists during gap periods.

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: System reset after 10/30 days based on time since last **accepted** measurement
- **Issue**: Users like 0040872d experienced unnecessary resets despite having rejected measurements
- **After**: System only resets when there's been **no measurement activity** (accepted or rejected) for 10/30 days

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Structure Enhancement
Added two new fields to processor state:
```python
{
    'last_timestamp': datetime,           # Last accepted measurement (unchanged)
    'last_attempt_timestamp': datetime,   # Last measurement attempt (NEW)
    'rejection_count_since_accept': int,  # Count of rejections since last accept (NEW)
    ...
}
```

### 2. Modified Files

#### src/processor.py
- **Lines 88-99**: Update state tracking on every measurement attempt
  - Set `last_attempt_timestamp` for all measurements
  - Increment `rejection_count_since_accept` on rejections
  - Reset counter on successful acceptance
  
- **Lines 121-128**: State migration for backward compatibility
  - Auto-populate missing fields from existing states
  - Ensures smooth transition for existing users

- **Lines 149-156**: Modified reset logic
  - Calculate gap using `last_attempt_timestamp` instead of `last_timestamp`
  - Maintain separate tracking for validation vs reset decisions

- **Line 508-516**: Updated DynamicResetManager
  - Uses attempt timestamp for gap calculations
  - Tracks rejection count in metadata

#### src/kalman.py
- **Lines 33-39**: Initialize new fields in state
- **Lines 98-103**: Reset rejection counter on successful update

### 3. Key Behavioral Changes

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 35 days with rejected data at day 15 | Reset triggered | No reset (activity detected) |
| 35 days with no data at all | Reset triggered | Reset triggered (unchanged) |
| Multiple rejections over 40 days | Reset triggered | No reset (continuous activity) |
| Questionnaire + 12 days with rejection at day 8 | Reset triggered | No reset (activity within window) |

### 4. Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in `tests/test_no_reset_with_rejections.py`:
- ✅ Rejected measurements prevent reset
- ✅ True data gaps still trigger reset  
- ✅ Multiple rejections tracked correctly
- ✅ Questionnaire-specific thresholds respected
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### 5. Validation Results

```
SCENARIO 1: Rejected measurements within 30-day window
Day 1: 100.0kg - ✅ ACCEPTED
Day 16: 120.0kg - ❌ REJECTED (Extreme deviation)
Day 36: 98.0kg - ✅ ACCEPTED
Result: NO RESET (gap from attempt: 20 days < 30 days)

SCENARIO 2: True data gap (no measurements)
Day 1: 100.0kg - ✅ ACCEPTED
Day 36: 95.0kg - ✅ ACCEPTED  
Result: RESET TRIGGERED (gap: 35 days > 30 days)
```

## Benefits

1. **Fewer False Resets**: Users actively monitoring weight won't lose state
2. **Better Continuity**: Kalman filter maintains context through rejection periods
3. **Improved User Experience**: Less disruption for users with fluctuating weights
4. **Data Quality Insights**: Rejection count provides quality metrics

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing states automatically migrated on first use
- Missing fields populated with sensible defaults
- No data loss or processing interruption
- Transparent upgrade for all users

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Only two additional fields in state
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses existing state management
- **Efficient**: O(1) operations for all checks

## Council Review

**Butler Lampson**: "Simple and effective - tracks what matters without overengineering."

**Barbara Liskov**: "Clean interface change that preserves existing contracts while extending functionality."

**Don Norman**: "Users won't notice the change except for better acceptance of their data - perfect UX improvement."

## Future Enhancements

Could extend this approach to:
- Track rejection reasons for pattern analysis
- Implement adaptive thresholds based on rejection patterns
- Provide user feedback about data quality trends
- Store limited rejection history for debugging

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Remove attempt timestamp check, revert to `last_timestamp` only
2. State fields can remain (harmless if unused)
3. No data migration needed for rollback

## Metrics to Monitor

- Reset frequency per user (should decrease)
- Rejection-to-reset ratio (should increase)
- User retention after rejections (should improve)
- Support tickets about "lost data" (should decrease)
