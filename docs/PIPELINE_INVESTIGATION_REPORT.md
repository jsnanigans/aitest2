# Weight Stream Processor Pipeline - Complete Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

The Weight Stream Processor is a sophisticated real-time data processing system that applies Kalman filtering to weight measurements from multiple sources. It processes CSV data streams, validates measurements against physiological limits, adapts to source reliability, and generates visualizations for quality assessment.

## 1. Entry Point & Orchestration (`main.py`)

### 1.1 Initialization Phase
- **Config Loading**: Reads `config.toml` for all processing parameters
- **Height Data Loading**: Pre-loads user height data from CSV for BMI calculations
- **Database Initialization**: Creates in-memory state database for Kalman persistence

### 1.2 Stream Processing Loop
The main loop processes CSV rows in true streaming fashion:

1. **User Filtering**:
   - Applies `test_users` list if specified (test mode)
   - Respects `user_offset` to skip initial users
   - Enforces `max_users` limit
   - Filters by `min_readings` requirement

2. **Date Filtering**:
   - Applies `min_date` and `max_date` boundaries
   - Tracks filtered measurement count

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filters out BSA (Body Surface Area) measurements
   - Detects and converts pounds to kilograms
   - Handles missing/malformed data

4. **Daily Batch Processing**:
   - Tracks measurements by day
   - When day changes, triggers cleanup for multi-measurement days
   - Uses `WeightReprocessor` to select best measurements

### 1.3 Processing Flow per Measurement
```python
For each weight measurement:
1. Parse and validate basic data
2. Convert units if needed (lb → kg)
3. Check date filters
4. Store for potential daily cleanup
5. Call process_weight_enhanced()
6. Track results and statistics
7. Update debug logs
```

## 2. Core Processing Pipeline (`src/processor.py`)

### 2.1 Enhanced Processing Entry (`process_weight_enhanced`)
This is the main processing function that orchestrates all components:

1. **Data Quality Preprocessing** (`DataQualityPreprocessor.preprocess`):
   - Unit conversion (pounds, stones → kg)
   - BMI detection (values 15-50 that look like BMI)
   - Height-based validation
   - Source-specific warnings

2. **Adaptive Configuration**:
   - Adjusts extreme deviation thresholds based on source
   - Modifies Kalman noise parameters per source reliability
   - Uses optimized multipliers from config

3. **Core Processing** (`WeightProcessor.process_weight`):
   - Loads/creates user state from database
   - Applies validation and Kalman filtering
   - Saves updated state

### 2.2 Stateless Weight Processor (`WeightProcessor`)
**Critical Design**: ALL methods are `@staticmethod` - completely stateless

Processing logic (`_process_weight_internal`):

1. **State Initialization Check**:
   - If no Kalman state exists, initialize immediately with first measurement
   - No buffering - processes from first value

2. **Gap Detection & Reset**:
   - Calculates time since last measurement
   - If gap > 30 days (or 10 days after questionnaire), considers reset
   - Validates against BMI before reset
   - Resets if BMI invalid or gap too large

3. **Physiological Validation**:
   - Checks absolute weight bounds (30-400 kg)
   - Validates change rate based on time elapsed
   - Detects multi-user sessions (rapid large changes)

4. **Kalman Filter Update**:
   - Predicts expected weight based on trend
   - Calculates deviation from prediction
   - Rejects if deviation > extreme threshold
   - Updates Kalman state if accepted

## 3. Kalman Filter Implementation (`src/kalman.py`)

### 3.1 State Representation
```python
kalman_state = {
    'kalman_params': {
        'initial_state_mean': [weight, trend],
        'initial_state_covariance': [[variance, 0], [0, 0.001]],
        'transition_covariance': [[weight_noise, 0], [0, trend_noise]],
        'observation_covariance': [[measurement_noise]]
    },
    'last_state': np.array([[weight, trend]]),
    'last_covariance': np.array([[[variance, 0], [0, 0.001]]]),
    'last_timestamp': datetime,
    'last_raw_weight': float
}
```

### 3.2 Key Operations

1. **Immediate Initialization** (`initialize_immediate`):
   - Creates Kalman state with first measurement
   - Sets initial trend to 0
   - Uses optimized variance parameters

2. **State Update** (`update_state`):
   - Calculates time delta for transition matrix
   - Applies Kalman filter update equations
   - Stores filtered state and covariance

3. **Confidence Calculation**:
   - Uses normalized innovation (prediction error)
   - Exponential decay function for smooth confidence scores

## 4. Validation System (`src/validation.py`)

### 4.1 Physiological Validator
Implements graduated limits based on time elapsed:

| Time Period | % Limit | Absolute Limit | Reason |
|------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| < 1 hour | 2% | 4.22 kg | Hydration/bathroom |
| < 6 hours | 2.5% | 6.23 kg | Meals + hydration |
| < 24 hours | 3.5% | 6.44 kg | Daily fluctuation |
| > 24 hours | - | 2.57 kg/day | Sustained change |

### 4.2 BMI Validator
- Calculates implied BMI using user height
- Detects physiologically impossible values
- Triggers Kalman reset for extreme changes
- Validates post-gap measurements

### 4.3 Threshold Calculator
Dynamic threshold adjustment based on:
- Source reliability profiles
- Time gaps between measurements
- Historical patterns

## 5. Data Quality System (`src/quality.py`)

### 5.1 Data Quality Preprocessor
**Height Data Management**:
- Loads height data for ~15K users from CSV
- Converts various units (cm, inches, feet) to meters
- Uses default 1.67m if user height unknown

**BMI Detection Logic**:
- If value is 15-50 in "kg" units
- Calculates implied weight: value × height²
- Converts if implied weight is reasonable (40-200 kg)

### 5.2 Adaptive Outlier Detector
- Adjusts thresholds based on source outlier rates
- More lenient for reliable sources
- Stricter for high-noise sources like iglucose.com

### 5.3 Quality Monitor
- Tracks rejection rates by source
- Identifies systematic issues
- Generates quality alerts

## 6. State Persistence (`src/database.py`)

### 6.1 In-Memory Database
- Stores Kalman state for all users in memory
- Serializes numpy arrays for JSON compatibility
- Supports snapshots for rollback

### 6.2 State Operations
- `get_state(user_id)`: Retrieve and deserialize
- `save_state(user_id, state)`: Serialize and store
- `create_snapshot()`: Save state for recovery
- `export_to_csv()`: Dump all states to CSV

## 7. Batch Reprocessing (`src/reprocessor.py`)

### 7.1 Daily Cleanup Process
When multiple measurements exist for a user on the same day:

1. **Kalman-Guided Selection**:
   - Uses current Kalman prediction as truth
   - Keeps measurements within threshold (default 4 kg)
   - Rejects outliers

2. **Statistical Fallback**:
   - If no Kalman state, uses median/clustering
   - Removes statistical outliers

### 7.2 Source Priority
Preference order for conflicting measurements:
1. Questionnaires (most trusted)
2. API sources (iglucose, connectivehealth)
3. Patient devices
4. Patient uploads

## 8. Visualization System (`src/visualization.py`)

### 8.1 Dashboard Components
Creates multi-panel visualization per user:

   - Confidence bands
   - Rejection markers

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Weekly weight change
   - Moving averages
   - Trend indicators

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Acceptance rate

## Conclusion

The Weight Stream Processor implements a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to handling noisy medical data. Its stateless architecture enables true streaming processing, while the adaptive configuration system handles diverse data sources effectively. The combination of Kalman filtering with physiological validation provides robust weight tracking even with highly variable input quality.

The system's key strength is its ability to adapt - to different sources, to data gaps, to quality issues - while maintaining mathematical rigor through the Kalman filter framework. This makes it well-suited for real-world medical data processing where perfect data is rare.
