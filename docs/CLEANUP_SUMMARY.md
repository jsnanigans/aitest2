# Code Cleanup and Configuration Summary

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Simplified Class Structure
- Removed unnecessary complexity
- Made private methods with `_` prefix for internal use
- Added public methods for backward compatibility where needed
- Extracted constants to class-level variables for maintainability

### 2. Better Code Organization
```python
# Before: Mixed public/private methods
def calculate_consistency_score(...)
def _weighted_harmonic_mean(...)

# After: Clear separation
def _calculate_consistency(...)  # Private implementation
def calculate_consistency_score(...)  # Public API for compatibility
```

### 3. Removed Unused Imports
- Removed `timedelta` (not used)
- Removed `get_source_reliability` (not used)
- Kept only necessary imports

### 4. Improved Readability
- Shorter method names internally (`_harmonic_mean` vs `_weighted_harmonic_mean`)
- Clear constants at class level (`HOURLY_MAX_KG`, `DAILY_MAX_KG`)
- Better docstrings focusing on what matters

## Configuration Cleanup

### Removed from config.toml:
- `dashboard_dpi` - Not used
- `use_basic_fallback` - Unnecessary complexity
- `enable_animations` - Not implemented
- `enable_insights` - Not used
- `insight_limit` - Not used
- `include_logo` - Not implemented

### Kept Essential Settings:
```toml
[quality_scoring]
enabled = true
threshold = 0.6
use_harmonic_mean = true

[quality_scoring.component_weights]
safety = 0.35
plausibility = 0.25
consistency = 0.25
reliability = 0.15
```

## Stateless Architecture Maintained

The implementation strictly follows the stateless requirement:

1. **No State Storage**: No instance variables store measurement history
2. **Minimal Context**: Only needs `previous_weight` and `time_diff_hours`
3. **Optional Parameters**: `recent_weights` is optional, not required
4. **Single Processing**: Each measurement processed independently

## Key Design Decisions

### Why No MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)?
- Would require storing 20+ recent weights in state
- Adds complexity to state management
- Simple z-score with fallback works well enough

### Why Hybrid Consistency Scoring?
- Pure percentage-based fails for small absolute changes
- Pure absolute-based fails for different body weights
- Hybrid approach balances both concerns

### Why Keep Public Methods?
- Tests depend on them
- External code might use them
- Backward compatibility is important

## Testing

All 21 tests pass:
```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_quality_scorer.py -q
# .....................
# 21 passed in 0.43s
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory**: O(1) - No history storage
- **Time**: O(1) - Fixed calculations per measurement
- **State Size**: ~16 bytes (2 floats: weight + timestamp)

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Don't Add State**: Resist adding `recent_weights` to required state
2. **Keep It Simple**: The current balance works well
3. **Test Coverage**: All methods have test coverage
4. **Config First**: New thresholds should go in config, not code

## Summary

The quality scorer is now:
- ✅ **Stateless** - Processes one measurement at a time
- ✅ **Simple** - Minimal complexity, clear structure
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Well-organized, documented
- ✅ **Configurable** - Key parameters in config.toml
- ✅ **Tested** - All tests passing
- ✅ **Performant** - O(1) time and space complexity
